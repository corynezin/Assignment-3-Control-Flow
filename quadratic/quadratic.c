/*
Name:

This program solves a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0
a, b, and c are already given as integers, and we assume a real solution
is possible.  Both solutions are stored in variables root1 and root2, and
the smaller root is printed before the larger.

Instructor Hints (You may delete this when submitting)

You should use the `sqrt` (square root) function provided in math.h (already
included)

sqrt is like a unary operator but called a little differently.  For example,

#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    printf("%f\n", sqrt(4.0));
}

prints 2.0
*/

#include <stdio.h> /* printf */
#include <math.h> /* sqrt */

int main () {
    int a = -1;
    int b = 1;
    int c = 1;
}
