This program prints the given character in binary.  It assumes a character is 8
bits.  The program will still work if you replace the hard coded character 'A'
with something else.

Instructor Hints (You may delete this when submitting)

You can use bitwise operators to extract each bit.  To get the rightmost bit,
you can use & with 1.  You can shift the bits to the right with the right bit
shift operator (>>).

You can also do the same with just arithmetic operators, though this may be the
one case where the bitwise operators are easier to read.
